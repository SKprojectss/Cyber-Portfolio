# Windows 11 Hardening Lab

## Goal
Harden a Windows 11 system against common network-based attacks and verify the results through attack simulation

## Environment
- Windows 11 (target)
- Windows Defender
- Windows Firewall
- Kali Linux (attacker)

## Initial State
Default Windows configuration with standard services enabled

## Actions (ongoing)
- Review open ports and services
- Harden firewall rules
- Disable unnecessary services (e.g. SMB where applicable)
- Enable Defender protections

## Verification
- Network scanning before and after hardening
- Observation of blocked connections
- Log review

## Status
This lab is ongoing and updated as I progress.

## What I Aim to Learn
- How exposed a default Windows system is
- How attackers discover targets
- How defensive changes affect attack surface
